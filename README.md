# Dread Hunger Server Overlay

## Introducing Dread Hunger Server Overlay
A simple Dread Hunger overlay made by Serega that you can use to start and join a server. It uses the same server infrastructure as Conductor Discord bot so all the same features are supported.

### Installation
To install the overlay, simply extract the files to `DreadHunger\Binaries\Win64`
(e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Dread Hunger\DreadHunger\Binaries\Win64`).

### Using the overlay 
Once in game, press ***O*** to open the overlay. We recommend pressing ***ESC*** first in order to get a cursor and then pressing ***O***. Once you have selected all the options for your game press ***Create Server*** and wait for a server to start (it will usually take around 20-30 seconds). Once the server is ready and you have a full lobby simply click on ***Join server*** and your game will start (there is no need to start the ship or drive it forward).

### FAQ
**?** Can I use the overlay to join a server that is not created using the overlay itself?
- Absolutely, Just copy the IP into the input field and click on ***Join Server***.

**?** Can I advertise my lobby in ***#⟴┊looking-for-group*** channel on Unofficial Dread Hunger Discord server?
- Yes, in order for your game to show in ***#⟴┊looking-for-group*** channel make sure to check the ***Send info to Discord*** option. The overlay will also track number of players in your lobby and update it (it may take 1 or 2 minutes to update your current number of players in the lobby).

### Troubleshooting
- Overlay says I'm not authorized

    In case you get the message that you are not authorized, try relaunching the game.
- Overlay is not opening

    If your overlay is not opening try updating your DirectX.

If these issues presist, or if you have any other issue, please contact us and we'll try to get it fixed.

## Mods information
We offer a number of mods you may use with the Overlay to enhance your games. All mods are server side meaning they don't require you to install or change anything in your game to run them.

Below is the list of supported mods as well as some more infor about them.
###  10 Inventory slots
Everyone has 10 inventory slots.
### 20 Inventory slots
Everyone has 20 inventory slots.
### 4 Spells
Thralls have 4 spells. One thrall will have Whiteout, while other one will have Hush.
### 5 Spells
Thralls can use all 5 spells.
### Armory on Blizzard
Armory will be automatically opened on the day of blizzard.
### Betrayal
When thrall dies he becomes a crewmate and a random crewmate will be picked to became a new thrall. Transfer can happen up to 4 times.
### Gun & Bow
Bow can be carried alongside Flintlock Pistol and Musket.
### Little People
The ship and players are shrinked. This mod is a bit clunky, but we included it for the lols.
### Lootable charms
Bone charms have a small random chance to spawn in containers. When thrall loots a bone charm their spell charge will be increased by one tier and spell cooldowns are reduced by 10 seconds. Bone charms are treated as trinkets so Chaplains passive should work on them (don't really have a good way to test this, but I suspect it is the case). 

Original mod has a feature which allowed crewmates to spirit walk with picked up bone charms, but we removed that part of the mod since it seemed too unbalanced.
### Low Gravity
You can jump higher.
### No Fall Damage
Players will not receive fall damage.
### No Prisoner
Players will be automatically released from the prison after death.
### Old Guns
This mod aims to recreate how guns worked before the armory update. Changes include:
- Muskets now spawn in strongboxes instead of gun parts
- Muskets damage is reduced to 65 from 75
- Gun parts can spawn in Ammo boxes, slots in ammo boxes are increased from 2 -> 4
- Flintlock can spawn on Officer skeletons (ones you dig up)
### Random roles
Players will be asigned a random role at the start of the game.
### Ship Automove
Ship will be automatically moved a bit further at the start of the game. Players will spawn without coal.
### Start w/ Spell Charge
Thralls will start the game with a small amount of spell charge.
### Quests
Players get a random quest, completing it gives you a reward at the start of next game. You will spawn with a quest item, to get a quest you need to drop it in some container and pick it up so it gets "consumed", similar to armory code.
### Quests Instant
Players get a random quest, completing it gives you a reward instantly. You will spawn with a quest item, to get a quest you need to drop it in some container and pick it up so it gets "consumed", similar to armory code.

These mods are customizable to some degree, so let us know if you have any suggestions for balance changes or even ideas for some variation of the mods.

All mods except *Old Guns* Is made by ***The Septenary Gods*** team, and only some minor tweaks were done to them for balance purposes.
